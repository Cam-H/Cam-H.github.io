											<h3>A selection of old projects</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I have been programming ever since participating in a particularly interesting high school
											course. While I initially began working with Java, I later developed competencies in other 
											languages as I became interested in different platforms. I have learnt PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQL
											to experiment with web development. I have also studied JCL, SAS, COBOL, Ladder Logic, and more for various internships.
											Nowadays, I work primarily with C++ and MATLAB (for modelling) so I recommend checking out <a href="autocarver.html" class="internal-link">AutoCarver</a>, my most recent project.
										</p>
										<p>
											Still here? Then perhaps you might take a look at some of these older projects?

											<h2><a href="https://github.com/Cam-H/SYR.git">SYR</a> - An exploration into game engine development</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											I got started working with C++ in working through the tutorial series developed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno">TheCherno</a>.

											I developed this project with the intent to understand how game engines work through the experience of an experienced game engine developer.
											While I eventually moved on to other projects, this represented by initial introduction to several important technologies and techniques:
										</p>
										<ul class="square-list">
											<li>Using <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> to interface with the GPU</li>
											<li>Utilizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language">GLSL</a> to produce shaders for diffuse and specular lighting</li>
											<li>Application of stencil testing for cell shading and other features</li>
											<li>Applying <a href="https://freetype.org/">FreeType</a> in the rendering of text</li>
											<li>Direct manipulation of meshes, and in particular how to develop custom mesh file loaders</li>
											<li>Use of entity component systems (ECS) like <a href="https://github.com/skypjack/entt">entt</a>, a more efficient alternative to standard inheritance</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											Although I did not end up developing SYR for a specific purpose, the understanding developed was critical for later projects like <a href="autocarver.html" class="internal-link">AutoCarver</a>.

										</header>
										<p>
											I participated in my school's FIRST robotics team, acting as the programming lead in my senior year. I later went on to
											mentor the team after graduating.

											<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Based on the cellular automata developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Horton Conway</a>. A set
											of simple rules give rise to rather interesting effects in a grid-based map. In each generation cells are treated with the following rules:
										</p>
										<ol class="number-list">
											<li>Any live cell with < 2 neighbors dies</li>
											<li>Any live cell with 2 or 3 cells survives</li>
											<li>Any live cell with > 3 neighbors dies</li>
											<li>Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes live</li>
										</ol>

											<h2>Pacman</h2>

											Developed in Java, I took my first foray into AI through a custom implementation of the classic game.
